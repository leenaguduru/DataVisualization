			<h4>Introduction:</h4>
			<p>In 19th century, Cholera was a major global scourge with frequent large-scale epidemics in European countries. Between 1848 and 1854, a series of cholera outbreaks occurred in London with large-scale loss of life. One epidemic of cholera occurred around Broad (now Broad wick Street) Street, Golden Square, in Soho, district of central London with unhygienic industries and housing. Dr. Snow, an obstetrician with an interest in many aspects of medical science, conducted pioneering investigations on cholera epidemics in in which he demonstrated that contaminated water was the key source causing the disease. His thorough investigation of an epidemic led to his conclusion that contaminated water from the Broad Street pump was the source of the disease and, consequently, the removal of the handle led to cessation of the epidemic. He further investigated about Cholera that they were receiving water from two water supply systems and one from the sewage contaminated portion of the Thames River and the other that drew its water upstream from an uncontaminated part of the river. He drew a map of London, of Water-distributed systems, he compared cholera cases among consumers of water of two suppliers depending upon their water intake. Rates of infection among clients of the distribution system drawing contaminated water far exceeded the rates among those served by the company whose water intake was from above the contaminated section of the river. This demonstration reinforced the goals of the sanitation movement, which developed sewage drainage systems and water purification systems in cities and towns in the following decades, this resulted in decrease in not only cholera but also various diseases.</p>
			<h4>Design Process:</h4>
            <div style="margin-left: 30px">
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-left: ;">In this project, I have recreated Dr. John Snow’s map. I used D3 JavaScript to create the Data Visualizations</li>
                    <li>In this recreation of the original map, I have created timeline chart and the pie charts for better understanding.</li>
                    <li>The timeline graphs and pie charts have elements like Age, Gender to make the visualization more interactive.</li>
                    <li>By hovering on the timeline graph, we can see the number of deaths occurred on the particular dates on the map.</li>
                    <li>The first pie-chart shows the no. of deaths by age group. You can see the age groups, death percentage and number of deaths.</li>
                    <li>The second pie-chart shows the number of deaths by sex i.e., Male and Female.</li>
                    <li>Then analyzed the valuable information from datasets.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

			<h4>Design Choices:</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>In the beginning, I started doing sketches on the paper for the visualization by taking the datasets and their measures into consideration. There are correlations of the datasets. After understanding the datasets and their data, I tried to present my data in such a way that a person can easily lead a investigation on the cholera epidemic. Initial Visualization has a map, which has streets and pumps, locations of the deaths. I have used pie chart and timeline graph to analyze the correct amount of the deaths occurred in that area. You can also see the number of deaths occurred on a specific date. The brown color represents the London streets and yellow color represents the pumps in that area. Also mentioned age groups in different colors. I’ve also added Zoom-in and Zoom-out functions to the map. For the other pie chart, I have used two colors Maroon and Purple for Male and Female respectively.</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Observations:</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>In the final Visualization, you can see more interactions in the map. There are two buttons Abstract and Video. The Abstract button redirects to the documentation and Video redirects to the interactive video that I have made.
					By observing the map, we can see that females are more affected than the male. By hovering on the first pie chart, user can be able to see the number of deaths by age group. we can see in the visualization that age group from 0 to 10 and age group greater than >80 is more affected by this incident than other age groups.
					Third, Timeline Graph which shows the death dates and number of the deaths occurred on that date. You can observe high death rate occurred in between 9th August and 10th September. Also, the highest death occurred is on 1st September.
					Then I have added the pie-charts where the user can have a clear percentage of deaths by Age group and Sex.
